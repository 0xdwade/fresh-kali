# fresh-kali
I got bored of doing the same thing over and over again. Not reinventing the wheel, just wanted to customize it and see if I could do it.
Feel free to update this script as you like. If you come across any issues let me know. If you think of someway I can make this script better let me know!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thedustywade/fresh-kali.git
```


```sh
```sh
cd fresh-kali
```
```sh
chmod +x freshkali.sh
```
```sh
sh sudo ./freshkali.sh
```
```
